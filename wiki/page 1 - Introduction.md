# Welcome to out Facebook App in Advanced Programming Project !
The course took place in our 2nd year of computer science in Bar-Ilan university, we did this project throughout the first semester.

Our project was to build a facebook app, both for web and android. In the web part we used react, node.js, css, HTML, CPP. And in the android we used android studio.
In this project we also implemented a server side that was working with a local MongoDB for updating and getting data base for our users and posts of the application.

In the project we had 4 phases :
1) Building a Bloom Filter in C++
2) Building the app of Facebook in React website and android studio.
3) Building a Node.js server and implementing MVC structure fir web and MVVM for android.
4) Building a TCP server aand connecting to the BloomPart, Node.js server and to both of the apps.

This wiki folder will contain 4 parts. <br>
First one, as you can see is the introduction. The second, will be about how to run the TCP server and the Node.js server. The third, will be about the web facbook app. And, the fourth, will be about the android fabook app. <br>.

We will explain everything in here, including photos and videos and yet we still reccommend you to go and read the README for each part, so you'll also be able to see our work in progress.
